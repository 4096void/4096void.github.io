> 因此，龙树菩萨首先要搞清楚，现象世界的因果，最终如何变成精神上的苦乐，甚至改变生命的循环。那时候的佛教将因果关系分成四种：「因缘」、「缘缘」、「次第缘」或「等无间缘」和「增上缘」。譬如说，橙的种子是因，种出橙子是果，这个关系是最基本的「因缘」。把橙子放进口里，舌头接触到甜味与酸味，产生「好味」的感觉，便是「缘缘」，亦是物质世界与精神世界的桥梁。这种感觉瞬即消逝，脑里却升起小时候爸爸把橙子分给我们吃的温馨。这些念头一个接一个地出现，此起彼落，毫不间断，故名「次第缘」或「等无间缘」。其他所有间接帮助这颗种子，甚至没有阻碍种子成长的，都叫「增上缘」。即使说，阳光雨水与空气固然是「增上缘」，雀鸟没有把种子吃掉、暴风没有把树吹折都算是「增上缘」。所以，几乎整个世界都是「增上缘」。「增上缘」涵盖如此之广，难怪龙树菩萨都只好说：「更无第五缘」。

> Honestly, I was a little bit grander about the whole thing. I realized I wanted to figure out how a Shoshannah-shaped brain can end up doing uniquely Shoshannah-shaped stuff, and basically explore the part of reality and possibility space that can only be explored by someone with my exact brain and circumstances.

> This logic can apply to everyone. You are the only person who ever lived and will ever live who can explore what it's like to do stuff exactly your way, with your brain, and get the exact results you will get.

> Simple - for every activity you naturally want to do, try to figure out a way to apply it to your direction. Your direction is sort of like a theme - if your direction is X and your interest is Y, then go do X-flavored Y-things

> If you can engineer a life that’s at least benign for other people that’s mostly chanda, you are doing well. And if you can design a life where getting your chanda is also good for others, you are insanely fortunate. Most materially wealthy people live in a prison, compared to the freedom you enjoy. Be completely grateful that you and the world can operate in joyful harmony.
